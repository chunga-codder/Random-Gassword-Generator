# Random-password-Generator

this code is to generate a randome passwork ,the user could modify the length of the password and 
also, he is able to chose from a list of uptions using check boxes if to add upper case laters,
lower case laters, numbers or special characters.

They will also have the possibility of chosing the password length with a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128 characters.

# FUNCTIONALITY

 In this project, i have mainly used the math.random method and a for loop to loop throught my characters the number less than the characters length number to get 
 any random number to add to the password field depending on the password lenght the user has chosed.
 In it, i also added and if element to help me chose the function which will be executed if the user choses any check box, i think, just open the password generator,
 if you try to generate when you have not chosen any character uption, you will be alerted to chose the character type,and the length can be adjusted 
 with the range being and increament of 10 ,but you can still chose inbetween the 10 increment.
 then after chosing the length and the character set, you just go ahead and click on generate, my generate function in my sript.js will be called and it will randomly select the characters
 respecting the length and the character types you have chosen with the help of my for loop and my if statements
